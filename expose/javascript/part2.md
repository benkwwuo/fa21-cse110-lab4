1. 3

4. This function returns nothing because javascript does not support returning multiple values unless they are packed into an object. 
5. Error, since i was defined with let and console.log(i) is outside the scope of where i was defined, i is not defined so line 12 raises an error. 
6. [ 50, 100, 150 ]
7. 150
8. Same explanation as #4, the function is attempting to return an array when javascript does not support returning multiple values. 
9. Error, i was initialized with let and console.log(i) is outside the scope or where i was defined, so it raises an error because i is not defined.

12. A) alert(student[name]);    B) alert(student['Grad Year']);   C) student.greeting();    D) alert(student['Favorite Teacher'][name]);    E) alert(student[courseLoad][0]);
13. A) '32' B) 1 C) 3 D) '3null' E) 4 F) 0 G) '3undefined' H) NaN
14. A) true B) false C) true D) false E) false F) true
15. == is a regular equality check where the operands of varying types are convered to numbers then compared, so like true becomes 1 so in a comparison of if 1 == true, it is treated as if  1 == 1 which is true. === is a strict equality operator that does not type convert types, so it basically compares the data types as they are given. If we did changed if 1 == true to 1 === true, 1 is obviously not equal to true. 
16. js file is in the same directory
17. The result should be double of the input array, so [1,2,3] becomes [2,4,6]. 
18. js file is in the same directory
